> Author: A frontend engineer with 11 years of experience, dedicated to improving development experience and efficiency through AI.

## 🧠 Origin

33+ years old, navigating the technological tide. I firmly believe that AI is not a replacement for frontend engineers, but rather a cognitive exoskeleton and efficiency lever. This handbook is my public record of systematic learning, practice, and reflection, aimed at drawing a navigation map for this new era together with fellow travelers.
